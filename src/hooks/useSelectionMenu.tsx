/**
 * What the ⋯ of a selection offers on every screen, built once here (#164).
 *
 * Favouriting is two fixed entries rather than one that flips, because a
 * selection can hold songs on both sides of the heart and one button would
 * have to pick a direction for it. Each entry touches only the songs it
 * applies to: starring a favorite again moves it to the top of the list for
 * nothing.
 *
 * Exporting and deleting downloads are about files, so they only show up where
 * this profile has any, and they say so when none of the songs marked is one
 * of them. Which songs those are is not known until the action runs, so the
 * entry cannot hide itself for a selection that has nothing to give.
 *
 * The export question comes back as a node for the screen to render: the bar
 * is gone by the time it is asked, since choosing an action leaves selection
 * mode.
