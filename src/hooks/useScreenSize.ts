/**
 * The size of the screen, as it is right now (#131).
 *
 * Every measurement in the app used to be a module constant, read once from
 * `Dimensions.get('window')` when the file was first imported. That is the
 * width the app started at, and it never changes again: turning the phone
 * sideways left every card, every grid and the whole player laid out for a
 * screen that is no longer there. So the rule from here on is that anything
 * derived from the width is derived during the render, from this hook, which
 * is `useWindowDimensions` with names on the numbers.
 *
 * Three questions get asked of a screen, and they are not the same question:
 *
 * `landscape` is only which way round it is. A phone on its side is landscape
 * and is still a phone.
 *
 * `wide` is whether there is room for more than one thing across, and it goes
 * by the SHORTEST side, so a tablet stays a tablet when it is turned. Six
 * hundred is Android's own line between a phone and a tablet, and using
 * anybody else's number here would only mean disagreeing with the system about
 * what the device is.
 *
 * `short` is the one that actually bites on a phone in landscape: 400-odd
 * points of height, where anything that wanted a square cover and a column of
 * controls underneath has to be laid out side by side instead.
