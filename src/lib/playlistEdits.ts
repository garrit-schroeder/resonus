/**
 * Whether a hand may rewrite a playlist on the server.
 *
 * Two things say it, and servers disagree about which of them they tell you.
 *  Whose list it is comes as the owner, and a server that sends no owner says
 *  nothing rather than "nobody", which counts as yours - the Library filters
 *  its lists by exactly that, so the rule cannot live in that screen and be
 *  written again in another. Whether the list has an order of yours to rewrite
 *  at all comes as `readonly` on the servers that speak OpenSubsonic: a smart
 *  playlist's songs come out of the rules it was built with on the server, so
 *  moving a row in one would not move a song but ask the server to forget its
 *  rules, and a list somebody else owns is only ever read to you.
