/**
 * The row that sits between a browse list and its search box, shaped like the
 * one a genre has: what you do to the list on the left, what starts it on the
 * right.
 *
 * It replaced a scrolling row of order pills, and the reason is what the pills
 * left behind. Play and shuffle on their own had nothing on that side of the
 * screen to sit beside, so they read as a green circle alone in an empty band;
 * a genre's pair looks settled because a group of controls holds the other end
 * of the row. The order was already the obvious candidate: as pills it was a
 * second scrolling row of the same shape as the sections above it, which made
 * the two hard to tell apart at a glance.
 *
 * The order is spelled out next to the icon rather than hidden behind it, the
 * way "Your library" writes it, so nothing is lost by the menu: what the list
 * is sorted by is still readable without opening anything.
