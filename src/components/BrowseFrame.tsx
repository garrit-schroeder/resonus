/**
 * What a "browse everything" screen sits in.
 *
 * On its own it is a screen: it starts under the status bar and there is a
 * back arrow above it. Inside the Explore tab it is the body of somebody
 * else's screen, and the chrome above it is theirs — the tab has already taken
 * the inset and already says which section you are in, so a second header
 * there would be the section named twice.
 *
 * Only the frame is shared. Each screen keeps its own header markup, because
 * what goes in it differs (a view menu, an add button, the swap the song list
 * does while selecting) and hiding that behind props made the headers harder
 * to read than the four lines it saved. Embedded, the one button that survives
 * is drawn by the tab instead — see `BrowserProps`.

/**
 * What every one of them takes.
 *
 * `actionRef` is how the button in the tab's header reaches the menu it opens,
 * which lives down here with the state it belongs to. The section fills it in
 * while rendering, the way `SheetModal` takes its `openRef`.
 *
 * `searchOpen` is the other half of that arrangement, and it goes the other
 * way: embedded, whether the box is there at all is the tab's to say, because
 * the magnifier that opens it is drawn up there and turns into the X that
 * closes it. A ref would have done for opening it, but then two places would
 * hold the same fact and the day they disagree the icon says close and the tap
 * opens (see `useSearchBox`).
